# Creating your repository

On github create a new repository and initialise it with the Android .gitignore file.
This will prevent you checking in intelij / Android specific build files which will fill up your repo with junk

# Using your repository
Instead of creating a new repository for every project done in class, you should use the same repo for multiple projects but place each project in a seperate folder.
