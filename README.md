# Creating your repository

You can choose to save your work on a USB stick but it will be much safer and better practice to use Github to store your work as you go along. 

1. If you do not have one, create a new account on github

2. On github, create a new repository for the class. Name is something like CM504 or solent_MAD. 
IMPORTANT initialise the repository with the Android .gitignore file. (you may also select to create a README.md file). 
This will prevent you checking in intelij / Android specific build files which will filling up your repo with junk

3. check out your new repository onto your local machine. 
First create a new folder near the root of C: drive, call it gitrepos. 
Right click on the folder and Open a git bash terminal. 
Get the url of the repository by right clicking on CLONE OR DOWNLOAD. Copy the HTTPS url and in the git terminal type
```
git clone https://-YOUR REPOSITORY URL-
cd -YOUR REPOSITORY-
git status
```
This will check you have correctly checked out the repo. You will need to check out the repo every week as the C: drive will be wiped.

# Using your repository
Instead of creating a new repository for every project done in class, you should use the same repo for multiple projects but place each project in a seperate folder.

Create a new folder called session1. Use this folder to create your new android project as explained in Nicks notes in https://edward2.solent.ac.uk/course/mad/part1.xhtml . However you should create the project in the folder you have just created in your repo as below;
